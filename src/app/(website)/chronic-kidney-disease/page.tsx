      <h1>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</h1>

      <p>
        Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition in which
        the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and
        excess fluids from the blood. It is a major public health concern
        in the United States.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of Chronic Kidney Disease</h2>
      <p>
        Common causes include diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune
        diseases, long-term medication use, and genetic factors.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms of CKD</h2>
      <p>
        Early stages may show no symptoms. As CKD progresses, symptoms
        may include fatigue, swelling, changes in urination, and
        elevated creatinine levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment focuses on slowing disease progression through medical
        care, lifestyle changes, and supportive therapies.
