      <h1>Herbal Treatment of Kidney Disease</h1>

      <p>
        Herbal treatment of kidney disease focuses on plant-based
        formulations traditionally used to support urinary health,
        digestion, and metabolic balance.
      </p>

      <h2>Can Herbal Treatment Help?</h2>
      <p>
        Herbal approaches are used as supportive care and should not
        replace medical treatment. Patients should consult qualified
        healthcare professionals.
      </p>

      <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        In the United States, herbal supplements are not regulated as
        prescription drugs. Professional guidance is essential.
