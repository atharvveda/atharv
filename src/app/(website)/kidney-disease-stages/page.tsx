      <p>
        Chronic kidney disease is classified into five stages based on
        glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which measures kidney function.
      </p>

      <h2>Stage 1 to Stage 5 Explained</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Stage 1: Normal or high GFR (90+)</li>
        <li>Stage 2: Mild loss of kidney function</li>
        <li>Stage 3: Moderate kidney damage</li>
        <li>Stage 4: Severe kidney damage</li>
        <li>Stage 5: Kidney failure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Early detection and management are essential to slow progression.
