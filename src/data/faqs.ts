        question: "Can Ayurveda really help reduce high creatinine levels?",
        answer: "Yes, Ayurveda focuses on treating the root cause of kidney dysfunction by improving filtration and reducing the burden on the kidneys. Herbs like Punarnava and Gokshura are traditionally used to help balance fluid levels and support renal function, which may assist in managing creatinine levels naturally in consultation with your nephrologist."

        question: "Is it safe to restart Ayurvedic treatment while on dialysis?",
        answer: "Ayurveda can be a supportive therapy alongside dialysis. It aims to improve your quality of life, energy levels, and digestion. However, you must NOT stop dialysis without your nephrologist's approval. Our doctors work to create a safe, complementary plan that respects your specific medical needs."

        question: "Do I have to follow a strict diet during treatment?",
        answer: "Diet (Ahaar) is 50% of the cure in Ayurveda. For kidney patients, we design a personalized diet plan that is low in potassium and sodium but rich in nutrition to support tissue repair. We guide you on exactly which vegetables and grains are safe for your stage of CKD."

        question: "How long does it take to see results?",
        answer: "Ayurveda is not a quick fix; it is a healing process. Most patients report improvements in energy and symptoms within 4-6 weeks. Changes in lab markers like GFR or creatinine vary by individual and disease stage. Consistency is key."

    {
        question: "Are your Ayurvedic medicines heavy metal free?",
        answer: "Absolutely. At Atharv Veda, safety is our priority. We prescribe only authentic, plant-based formulations that undergo rigorous quality checks. We strictly avoid herbo-mineral preparations that could be taxing on compromised kidneys."
