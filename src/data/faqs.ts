        question: "Can Ayurveda really help reduce high creatinine levels?",
        answer: "Yes, Ayurveda focuses on treating the root cause of kidney dysfunction by improving filtration and reducing the burden on the kidneys. Herbs like Punarnava and Gokshura are traditionally used to help balance fluid levels and support renal function, which may assist in managing creatinine levels naturally in consultation with your nephrologist."

    {
        question: "Is it safe to restart Ayurvedic treatment while on dialysis?",
        answer: "Ayurveda can be a supportive therapy alongside dialysis. It aims to improve your quality of life, energy levels, and digestion. However, you must NOT stop dialysis without your nephrologist's approval. Our doctors work to create a safe, complementary plan that respects your specific medical needs."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I have to follow a strict diet during treatment?",
        answer: "Diet (Ahaar) is 50% of the cure in Ayurveda. For kidney patients, we design a personalized diet plan that is low in potassium and sodium but rich in nutrition to support tissue repair. We guide you on exactly which vegetables and grains are safe for your stage of CKD."

    {
        question: "How long does it take to see results in Chronic Kidney Disease?",
        answer: "Ayurveda is not a quick fix; it is a holistic healing process. Most patients report improvements in energy, sleep, and appetite within 4-6 weeks. Changes in lab markers like GFR or creatinine vary by individual and disease stage. Consistency in diet and medicine is key for long-term health."
    },
    {
        question: "Are your Ayurvedic medicines heavy metal free and safe for kidneys?",
        answer: "Absolutely. At Atharv Veda, safety is our priority. We prescribe only authentic, plant-based formulations that undergo rigorous quality checks. We strictly avoid 'Rasa-Aushadhis' (herbo-mineral preparations) that could be taxing on compromised kidneys."

    {
        question: "What is the Ayurvedic approach to Nephrotic Syndrome?",
        answer: "In Nephrotic Syndrome, Ayurveda aims to repair the glomerular basement membrane to prevent protein leakage. We use 'Sothahara' (anti-inflammatory) and 'Rasayana' (rejuvenative) herbs to strengthen the kidneys and balance the immune system naturally."
    },
    {
        question: "Can Ayurveda help avoid kidney transplant?",
        answer: "While Ayurveda cannot guarantee the avoidance of a transplant in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), it focuses on maximizing the residual function of the kidneys. In many cases of Stage 3 and 4 CKD, timely intervention helps stabilize the condition and may delay the need for dialysis or transplant."
    },
    {
        question: "Is Ayurvedic kidney treatment expensive?",
        answer: "At Atharv Veda, we believe everyone deserves access to quality care. Our treatment is structured to be affordable compared to long-term dialysis costs. We focus on ethical practice and providing the most effective herbs at a reasonable price point."
